# Read Me for Project 2 - FYS-STK4155 Autumn 2020

Initially a file for each of the methods listed as

 - Neural Network for regression
 - Neural Network for classification
 - Logistic regression


Hopefully it would be really tide to have the class environments for NN in a seperate file to be called upon. Also having the arcitecture of the logstic regression in a different, including the idea of gradient descent.
This would make the reading experience more structured and the "main" more about the figures and central ideas we want to discuss.

### Ulitmately use more time making graphs and exploring.
